      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>

      <p>
        Like most website operators, we collect non-personally-identifying
        information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
        available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
        site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in
        collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
        understand how our visitors use our websites. From time to time, we may
        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
        by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. We do not
        collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses.

      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

      <p>
        Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with them in ways
        that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
        and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the
        interaction. For example, we ask visitors leave information on contact
        form to provide their name and email address for the purpose of
        contacting them.
