title: "Full-Stack Migration with Confidence"
description: "We partnered with a Berlin-based B2B SaaS company during the early phase of a full-stack migration, replacing their PHP-based system with a modern technology stack to support future growth and scalability. Our role was to enable engineering teams and leadership to adopt the new tech stack with clarity and confidence while continuing to deliver. Through leadership alignment, hands-on enablement, and a focused PoC phase, we helped teams reduce uncertainty, understand trade-offs, and build the internal capability needed to carry the migration forward independently."

abstract: "Large-scale technology migrations often fail not because of the tools or technical feasibility, but because teams lack shared context, confidence, and clarity in how complex changes are executed. In this case study, we describe how we supported a Berlin-based product organization during the adoption of a new full-stack technology platform. By starting with leadership alignment, supporting engineers through a real delivery-focused PoC that included AI-assisted feature development, and gradually reducing involvement as confidence grew, we enabled a smooth transition from evaluation to ownership. The result was an organization equipped to continue the migration independently, with aligned practices, informed trade-offs, and sustained momentum."

Full-stack migrations raise more than technical questions. They force organizations to confront how decisions are made, how teams learn, and how confidence is built while delivery continues. This is especially important when features are being generated or assisted by AI, which requires careful review and architectural guidance.

We partnered with a Berlin-based product company as they began a planned PoC phase for a full-stack migration. The initiative had already been set in motion internally, proposed by a staff engineer who saw the opportunity for modernization. Our role was to support the structured PoC phase, helping teams assess the stack by building a limited set of real features. This approach allowed engineers to learn quickly while delivering value, and to gain practical insights into whether the stack met the organization’s needs.

## Aligning on What Matters

Before implementation began, we focused on creating shared clarity around priorities and constraints. Through structured surveys and in-depth conversations with engineering leadership, including the CTO, VP of Engineering, and the staff engineer who proposed the stack, we worked to surface what success meant for the organization.

These discussions made trade-offs explicit. Instead of treating values like speed, simplicity, consistency, and flexibility as abstract ideals, they became practical decision criteria. Teams could refer to these when choices conflicted, helping reduce the risk of reactive or inconsistent decisions later. Clarifying these priorities also helped us understand how to balance competing goals, such as whether it was more important to deliver features quickly or to focus on the learning process for the team.

In parallel, we spent time with the engineering teams themselves. We listened to concerns, expectations, and previous experiences, particularly from senior engineers who had seen multiple migrations started but not completed. This context allowed us to approach the PoC phase in a way that addressed practical concerns and built confidence. By understanding team dynamics, working styles, and preferences, we tailored our collaboration approach to foster open communication and early questioning, enabling team members to learn faster, progress steadily, and gradually become more comfortable raising questions without being prompted by us.

## Fast-Tracking Development with AI and Skilled Engineers

Many of the features developed during the PoC phase were created with AI-assisted code generation. While AI helped produce functional solutions quickly, our guidance ensured that architectural choices were sound, trade-offs were understood, and generated code aligned with long-term goals. By combining AI-assisted development with hands-on mentoring, engineers could learn the stack faster and build confidence in when and how to apply AI effectively.

Our role during the PoC was to support learning while delivering real value. We paired with engineers on active tasks, reviewed PRs to provide guidance on both technical and architectural decisions, and facilitated a series of custom workshops to address recurring challenges and expand team knowledge. These workshops reinforced what was learned during pairing and PR reviews, allowing teams to internalize patterns and apply them directly to ongoing feature development. Feedback cycles were intentionally short, enabling early decisions to be discussed, validated, or adjusted before patterns became entrenched.

Solutions were kept simple and adaptable rather than optimized prematurely. This approach helped teams gain a practical understanding of the stack, its trade-offs, and its strengths, while maintaining momentum and shared direction across teams.

## Building Confidence Without Creating Dependency

Throughout the PoC, we regularly gathered feedback through surveys and one-on-one conversations. This gave visibility into how confidence, engagement, and perceived support evolved as teams gained hands-on experience.

Initially, engineers were hesitant to raise questions and waited on feedback. Over time, they became more comfortable asking questions and engaging in discussions ranging from foundational concepts to more complex implementation and trade-off decisions. This shift reflected both growing confidence with the stack and trust in the collaboration model.

Over time, we deliberately reduced our day-to-day involvement. Our role transitioned toward lighter advisory support, providing guidance and validation when needed, without slowing teams down or creating reliance on external support.

## Outcome

By the end of the engagement, the organization had moved from early exploration to experience-based confidence.

Engineering teams were able to deliver features using the new full stack, including AI-assisted implementations, while following consistent patterns and practices. Architectural and design decisions were made consciously, with trade-offs clearly understood. Alignment across teams improved, momentum was preserved, and engineers were able to navigate trade-offs independently.

Most importantly, the organization was positioned to continue the migration with minimal support, with engineers confident in both the technology and the decision-making framework around it, fully capable of progressing the stack and making informed decisions without external guidance.

## Our Role as a Technology Partner

This engagement was not about owning the migration or dictating solutions. It was about enabling people.

For a successful partnership, it was crucial to combine our technical expertise with the team’s deep understanding of their domain. While we brought guidance on the new stack, architectural decisions, and best practices, the team’s domain knowledge ensured that solutions were relevant and aligned with business needs. By complementing each other in this way, we could reduce risk, clarify trade-offs, and accelerate learning.

Custom workshops, pairing, and feedback-driven guidance were central to this approach. We delivered a series of tailored workshops that addressed recurring challenges, explored architectural decisions, and helped engineers become self-sufficient quickly. These workshops reinforced practical learning from the PoC phase and allowed teams to apply insights immediately to their work.

Acting as a technology partner with a focus on soft skills, we supported change in a collaborative rather than disruptive way. For engineering leaders navigating similar transitions, this approach helps ensure new technology is adopted with confidence, clarity, and sustainable momentum.
