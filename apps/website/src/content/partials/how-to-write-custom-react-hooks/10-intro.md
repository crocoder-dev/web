Unlock the full potential of **React** with custom hooks! In this blog post, we'll go through some exercises that can help you level up your react skills by writing custom hooks in **TypeScript**. From state management to performance optimization, you'll learn how to create reusable logic for your React components and make your code more efficient and scalable. Every exercise has a brief description of the problem, starting code and relevant links. Try to solve the problems without taking a peek at the solution.

I would suggest using [vite-react-app](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) to create a new project for this tutorial. It's a great tool that allows you to create a new React project with a single command.

```bash
# Create Vite + React app using npm
npm create vite@latest vite-react-app -- --template react-ts

# Create Vite + React app using yarn
yarn create vite --template react-ts

# Create Vite + React app using pnpm
pnpm create vite --template react-ts
```

**Custom React hooks** are user-defined functions that allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic and side effects from your React components. 

They let you encapsulate and share behavior between multiple components in a clean and reusable way. By using custom hooks, you can reduce the amount of code you write and make it easier to test as well as maintain your React applications.

Custom hooks can also help improve performance by allowing you to share state updates across multiple components and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
