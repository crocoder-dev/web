```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
export const useMousePosition = (): [{ x: number, y: number },
React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<{ x: number, y: number }>>] => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleMouseMove = (event: MouseEvent) => {
      setPosition({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY });
    };
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
    };
  }, []);
  return [position, setPosition];
};
// Use the hook in a component
import React from 'react';
import { useMousePosition } from './useMousePosition';
const MouseTracker: React.FC = () => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useMousePosition();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>X: {position.x}</p>
      <p>Y: {position.y}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
export default MouseTracker;
```

This code is a simple implementation of a custom hook in React with TypeScript. The custom hook is called **`useMousePosition`** and it returns the current mouse position on the screen, which is represented as an object with **`x`** and **`y`** properties.

The hook uses the **`useState`** and **`useEffect`** hooks from React to manage the state and side effects of the component. The **`useState`** hook is used to create a state variable **`position`** that stores the current mouse position, and a function **`setPosition`** that updates the state.

The **`useEffect`** hook is used to add a **`mousemove`** event listener to the window. The listener updates the state with the current mouse position when the mouse moves. The **`useEffect`** hook also returns a cleanup function that removes the event listener when the component unmounts.

The custom hook is then used in a component called **`MouseTracker`** that displays the current mouse position on the screen. The component uses the **`useMousePosition`** hook to get the current mouse position, and then displays the **`x`** and **`y`** values in a **`div`** element.

Finally, the **`MouseTracker`** component is exported as the default export from the module, making it possible to import and use the component in other parts of the application.
