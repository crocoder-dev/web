While importing the Input component from our internal component library for a company-related project, we encountered an issue that compelled us to completely reinvent how this component works. We realized that there was no way for a parent component to affect the value of the rendered [\<input\> HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input), and after reading through the source code, we decided to look for solutions and ultimately refactor our Input component.
