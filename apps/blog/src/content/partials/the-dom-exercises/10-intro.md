It's really hard to test your programming knowledge after you have completed a tutorial or a lecture. We have prepared some exercises to help out beginner devs to solidify their understanding of **the DOM**. Every exercise has a brief description of the problem, starting code, links to relevant MDN docs, and expected results. Try to solve the problems without taking a peek at the solution.

If you need some additional help, you can check out our [The DOM video](https://youtu.be/TWV2qERCPG4) from the **#lockdown learning** series or contact the author of the article directly.

The DOM or the Document Object Model of the page is created after the web page is loaded. It's constructed as a tree of objects, and with it, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
