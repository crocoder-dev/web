Solution

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
export const useClickCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  return [count, increment] as const;
};

// Use the hook in a component
import React from 'react';
import { useClickCounter } from './useClickCounter';
const ClickCounter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, increment] = useClickCounter();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Button has been clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default ClickCounter;
```

The **`useClickCounter`** custom hook uses the **`useState`** hook to keep track of the number of clicks on a button in a component. The **`useState`** hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value, and a function to update the state. In this case, the state is the **`count`** of clicks, which is initially set to 0.

The **`increment`** function is created to increment the count when the button is clicked. The function uses the **`setCount`** updater function returned by the **`useState`** hook to update the count by adding 1 to the previous count value.

The hook then returns an array that contains the **`count`** and the **`increment`** function.

The **`ClickCounter`** component imports the **`useClickCounter`** hook and calls it to get the count and increment function. The component then displays the number of clicks and uses the increment function as the **`onClick`** handler for the button.
