Solution

```tsx
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
interface UseClickTrackerState {
  count: number;
  lastClicked: number | null;
}
export const useClickTracker = (): [UseClickTrackerState, () => void] => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<UseClickTrackerState>({
    count: 0,
    lastClicked: null,
  });
  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setState(prevState => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1,
      lastClicked: Date.now(),
    }));
  }, [setState]);
  return [state, incrementCount] as const;
};
```

The custom hook **`useClickTracker`** provides a way for the component to track the number of times a button has been clicked and the time of the most recent click. The hook exports an array of two elements: **`state`** and **`incrementCount`**. The **`state`** object contains two properties: **`count`** and **`lastClicked`**. The **`count`** property keeps track of the number of times the button has been clicked, and **`lastClicked`** keeps track of the timestamp of the most recent click.

The hook uses the **`useState`** hook to manage the state of the component. The initial state of the component is an object with **`count`** set to 0 and **`lastClicked`** set to **`null`**. The **`setState`** function is used to update the state whenever the button is clicked.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useClickTracker } from './useClickTracker';
const ButtonClickTracker: React.FC = () => {
  const [state, incrementCount] = useClickTracker();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Button has been clicked {state.count} times</p>
      <p>
        Last clicked at:{' '}
        {state.lastClicked ? new Date(state.lastClicked).toLocaleString() : 'Never'}
      </p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default ButtonClickTracker;
```

The hook also uses the **`useCallback`** hook to ensure that the **`incrementCount`** function is only created once, even if the component is re-rendered multiple times. This can improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary functions.

The component **`ButtonClickTracker`** imports the hook and calls it using the **`useClickTracker`** hook. The hook returns an array with two elements: **`state`** and **`incrementCount`**. The component uses the **`state`** object to display the number of times the button has been clicked and the time of the most recent click. The component also uses the **`incrementCount`** function as the **`onClick`** handler for the button.
