    Unlock the full potential of <strong>React</strong> with custom hooks! In this
    blog post, we'll go through some exercises that can help you level up your react
    skills by writing custom hooks in <strong>TypeScript</strong>. From state
    management to performance optimization, you'll learn how to create reusable
    logic for your React components and make your code more efficient and
    scalable. Every exercise has a brief description of the problem, starting
    code and relevant links. Try to solve the problems without taking a peek at
    the solution.
